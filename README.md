- Difference between a Library and Framework?

  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/
  - Both frameworks and libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems.
  - Suppose, you have a house and you need some furnitures. Instead of building them from sractch, you went to Ikea and bought them. Ikea here is similar to a library. But in the case of framework, you want to build a house. The cotractor and the designer have the bluprint. You just need to follow the bluprint to build the house.
  - A library allows developers to call functions as needed, giving them control over the application flow. In contrast, a framework dictates the structure and flow of the application, calling the developer's code at specific points. This inversion of control is the main difference: libraries offer flexibility, while frameworks provide a predefined structure.

- What is CDN? Why do we use it?

  - A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.
  - A content delivery network (CDN) optimizes website performance by caching content on geographically distributed servers closer to end-users. This reduces latency and improves loading speeds, enhancing overall user experience. CDNs are crucial for high-speed content delivery, enabling companies like Reuters to distribute news rapidly worldwide using services such as Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3. They also facilitate real-time streaming by efficiently delivering rich media files, as seen with Hulu's use of CDNs to stream large volumes of data to their global audience. Moreover, CDNs support scalability by handling concurrent user demands effectively, as demonstrated by King's use in delivering gaming content across platforms to millions of players. Overall, CDNs play a vital role in ensuring reliable, fast, and scalable content delivery for diverse online applications.
